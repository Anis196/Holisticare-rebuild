# Spring Boot Rebuild

This folder contains the new implementation of the project using Java Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. All changes and new files will be created here as per the migration plan.

## Structure
- `backend/` - Spring Boot backend (Java, Maven, JUnit)
- `frontend/` - React frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript, npm)

## Backend
- Built with Spring Boot
- Uses Maven for build and dependency management
- JUnit for testing
- RESTful API endpoints
- Static assets in `src/main/resources/static`
- Configuration in `src/main/resources/application.properties`

## Frontend
- Built with React
- Consumes REST APIs from Spring Boot backend

## Migration Steps
1. Rebuild backend logic in Java (Spring Boot)
2. Refactor frontend to consume new API endpoints
3. Migrate environment/configuration
4. Update documentation and onboarding guides
5. Ensure all third-party integrations have Java support
6. Refactor frontend to consume new API endpoints

## Deployment
Deployment steps will be added after implementation.
