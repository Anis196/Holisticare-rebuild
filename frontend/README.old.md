# Frontend (React)

This folder contains the React frontend for the Spring Boot rebuild project.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## API Integration
- The frontend is configured to consume REST APIs from the Spring Boot backend.
- Update API endpoints in your React code to point to the backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/api/...`).

## Structure
- `src/` - React source code
- `public/` - Static assets

## Customization
- Add components, pages, and styles as needed.
